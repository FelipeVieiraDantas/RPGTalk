Unity-chan...? What are you doing here?
I'm here to learn more about Timeline in Unity and RPGTalk!
Well, RPGTalk is now integrated with Timeline, so you can build your cutscenes easily!
Really? Awesome!
I guess that the sounds can be played used te Timeline itself or using the RPGTalkDubSounds, so we can have something like different sounds for different languages.
That's right. These talks can be scripted but RPGTalk can also pause the timeline while waiting the player to finish the talk.
Really? Let me test it!
[dub=0]3... 2... 1...
[dub=1]Start!
It is true!
Yes it is! Now is even easier to build your own cutscenes!
I see! Thank you! Unity-chan is out!
