######### What's new? Version 1.2 #########
Version 1.2:

-Rich Text is now officially supported, even if the begging and the end tag are separated by different lines;
-Now is possible to place sprites inside the text, occupying space as if it were a character in the text;
-You can change the speed of the text while the talk is running;
-Timeline ready;
-Localization inside RPGTalk or any UI Text;
-Easier to change Target Follow during the talk;
-RPGTalk Area to change the text or interact with a character without any code;
-Line To Start and Line To Break can now be titles instead of fixed line numbers;
-The player can now make choices in the text;
-Dubbing is possible in every line and fully integrated with Localization.

Note: Every time that you update a Plugin, backup your project. In this update of RPGTalk you shouldn’t have much trouble, but you can loose your references to the targetFollow variable.
